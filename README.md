# Improvementbits 💪
Learning notes taken by a random guy trying to be a better software developer 😁.


# Motivation
After 1 year of learning just enough of both Frontend and Backend software development to get a job in the sotware industry, I have decided to specialise and focus more on the frontend aspect of things.
1. This blog will be a documentation of my journey as I grow and learn new skills about frontend development.
2. I want to master the fundamentals of frontend development by learning HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
3. I want to become so good, they cant ignore me 💪.
4. I am very sure I'll try all I can to become one of the best in my niche and I want this platform to always remind me of the journey so far.
